Wake me up before I die, hold me close
As I gaze upon the sky, comatose
Hmmm... no reason to survive, I suppose
Wake us up before we die
No need to feel desire
But I need you with me!
No need to feel so small
But I need to feel secure!
No need to feel the fire
But I need to feel free!
No need to feel at all
But I need to know for sure!
